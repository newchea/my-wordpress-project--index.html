# 🌱 Road to Coding

Hi, I’m **Macintosh Chea** — welcome to my personal coding journey!

This project is the beginning of something new. I’m learning how to build websites using **HTML** and **CSS**, and sharing my progress step by step.

## 🚧 Current Progress
- ✅ Created basic layout using `index.html`
- ✅ Linked CSS with `style.css`
- 🔜 Next: Add more pages and improve the design

## 🌐 Live Website  
Check it out here:

## 🛠 Goals
- Build a complete personal website
- Learn modern web design techniques
- Keep practicing and improving

      <h2>🌱 Where It All Began</h2>
      <p>
        It started with a simple question: "How do websites work?"<br/>
        I didn’t have much experience, but I had the drive to learn. One HTML tag at a time, I discovered a whole new world.

    <section>
      <h2>💡 The First Step</h2>
      <p>
        I created my first page — just a heading and a paragraph. It wasn’t perfect, but it was mine. Every mistake taught me something.

      <h2>🎯 What I’m Working On Now</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Learning CSS to style my pages</li>
        <li>Exploring GitHub to share my work</li>
        <li>Building a site called <strong>Music World</strong></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>🔥 My Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        I don’t code because it’s easy — I code because it helps me build what I imagine.<br/>
        The road is long, but I’m walking it one project at a time.
